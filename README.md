This mod addresses the issue of people being unable to enjoy the end to it's fullest on populated Minecraft servers. When installed, and after the first Dragon has died, end-travelers who have not yet killed the Dragon will be sent to a alternate end dimension, where they can do so and briefly explore. After they return, their next travel to the End will bring them to the shared End with everyone else on the server.

Only one alternate End exists at a time, and a server admin can reset it by calling `/endless renew`.
